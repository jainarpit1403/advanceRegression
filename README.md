# Assignment - Advance Regression
> Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, plans to enter the Australian market by using data analytics to buy houses below their market value and sell them at a higher price. They have collected a dataset of house sales in Australia and want to build a regression model using regularisation to predict the value of potential properties. The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting house prices and how well they can describe the price. Additionally, they need to find the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression to make informed investment decisions.
